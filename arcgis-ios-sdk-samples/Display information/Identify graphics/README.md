##How it works

It requires the `mapView:didTapAtPoint:mapPoint:` method on `AGSMapViewTouchDelegate` to know when a user tapped on the map. The method provides a property `mapPoint` which specifies the corresponding touch location in the map. The app then uses the `identifyGraphicsOverlay:screenCoordinate:tolerance:maximumGraphics:completion:` method on `AGSMapView` to identify graphics at that particular touch location.
